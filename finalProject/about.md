This application is developed as part of the requirement for the
**Coursera Data Science Capstone Course**. The goal of the project is to
build a predictive text model combined with a shiny app UI that will
predict the next word as the user types a sentence similar to the way
most smart phone keyboards are implemented today using the technology of
Swiftkey.

### Steps

1.  Upon initial load up of the application, **"NULL"** will be
    displayed at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2.  User may then enter a partially complete sentence to begin the next
    word prediction.

### Results

1.  Next word predicted is shown at the Predicted Next Word textbox.
2.  Information on the n-gram backoff algorithm used to predict is shown
    as indication.

#### Note:

The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the
GitHub repo: https://github.com/anushkawakankar/Word-Prediction
